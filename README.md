# 📘 CS50 2025 – Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my personal repository for [CS50x 2025](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's renowned introduction to computer science and the art of programming. 

This course covers foundational concepts in computer science and teaches problem-solving through C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each week introduces new topics, ending in a final project of your own design.

This repository documents my journey through CS50x 2025.
